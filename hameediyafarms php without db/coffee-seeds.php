                    <li class="my-2"><strong>Improved Mental Alertness: </strong> The caffeine in coffee seeds acts as a stimulant for the central nervous system, helping to increase alertness, concentration, and cognitive function.</li>
                    <li class="my-2"><strong>Enhanced Physical Performance:</strong>Caffeine can also improve physical performance by increasing adrenaline levels and releasing fatty acids from fat tissues, which are used as fuel for physical activity.</li>
                    <li class="my-2"><strong>Antioxidant Properties:</strong> Coffee seeds contain antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acids, which help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body. Antioxidants are beneficial for overall health and may contribute to reducing inflammation.</li>
                    <li class="my-2"><strong>Potential Lower Risk of Certain Diseases:</strong> Regular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of certain diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. The exact mechanisms are still being studied, but antioxidants and other bioactive compounds in coffee may play a role.</li>
                    <li class="my-2"><strong>Improved Mood:  </strong>  Coffee consumption is often associated with improved mood and reduced risk of depression. Caffeine's stimulating effects can contribute to a temporary mood lift and increased feelings of well-being.
